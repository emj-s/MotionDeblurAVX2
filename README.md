## Description

The proposed program is an AVX2-optimized deblurring pipeline that runs on NASM and C++. The aim of the project is to avchieve image deblurring with real-time performance while preserving the quality.

The project utilizes Sobel filter for edge detection and Weiner deconvolution that will later be parallelized to optimize the performance and maximize CPU utilization.
